# RakPy

Pythonic implementation of RakNet protocol **WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Project goals

* Provide a pythonic interface (other projects exists but they feel like Java or PHP)
* Provide a decent test suite
* Parts of the code are generated from YAML files (so we can move fast by tweaking YAML, and we can share this with other projects)
